# Mapping

## Cartesian product

### Definition

>Given sets A and B, we can define a new set A >× B, called the
>Cartesian product of A and B, as a set of ordered pairs. That is,
>
>$$A × B = {(a, b) : a ∈ A, b ∈ B}$$

:::details Example
Let A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {x, y}, and \ then
$$A × B = {(1, x), (1, y), (2, x), (2, y), (3, x), (3, y)}$$
$$A × C = \emptyset$$
:::

We define the Cartesian product of n sets to be A1 × A2 × ... × An = {(a1, a2, ..., an) : ai ∈ Ai for i = 1, .., n} If A1 = A2 = ... = An, we write An for A × A.... × A.

- Example: R^3 consists of all of 3-tuples of real numbers.

### Definition 2

>Intuitively, an injective (or one-to-one) function never maps distinct
elements of its domain to the same element of its codomain.

## Mapping

### Definition

>- Mapping is a proces that each element of a set X (domain) is associated with one and only one
>  element of a set Y (range/codomain).
>- Domain: The set of allowed inputs
>- Codomain: The set of allowed outputs

- A map is often used as a synonym for a function. Only <b>one-to-one</b> and <b>many-to-one</b> can be called a function.

### Definition 2

> Consider the functions f : A → B and g : B → C, the composition of these two functions f ◦ g : A → C
